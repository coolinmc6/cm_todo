# README

* This is a todo app that allows users to create new lists, add items to those lists, check them off to signify that
they are complete, and be logged in to view/edit lists.
* Before I get started, here are some notes...

## Getting Started

### Gems
* Here are the gems that I am adding:
```ruby
#Gems I've added
gem 'haml', '~> 4.0', '>= 4.0.7'
gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3', '>= 3.3.7'  # needs to be configured
gem 'simple_form', '~> 3.3', '>= 3.3.1' 		# needs to be configured
gem 'devise', '~> 4.2' 											# needs to be configured
```
* I believe that HAML is the only one that I don't need to configure -> I'm right, nothing needed

### Models, Views, Controllers
* I really don't know everything that I'll need but this is what I think I need right now:
  * Models: ToDo Lists, ToDo items, Users (via Devise, not right away)
* I will list out the views as I think of them
